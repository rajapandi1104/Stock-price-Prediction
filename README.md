There are many other neural networks like Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are typically Feed Forward Networks (FFNNs) in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without going backward3 and the links between the layers are one way which is in the forward direction and they never touch a node again. The result shows that the Lstm is much more accurate than SVM and Linear regression Because LSTM have good performance on time series data So we can conclude that LSTM method has the best accuracy, namely, the simulated streamflow to the dam reservoir with 95% accuracy in the training stage and 90% accuracy in the testing stage. LSTM give good prediction on time series data of long durations.
